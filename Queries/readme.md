### Queries Folder

The `Queries/` folder contains all **SQL scripts used to analyze IoT device data** and answer **business-driven user stories**. Each query is designed to extract insights from the fact and dimension tables, generate actionable metrics, and support decision-making.  

**List of Queries and Their Purpose:**

1. **`total_usage.sql`** – Calculates total usage hours or uptime per device for Device Performance Monitoring.  
2. **`top_devices.sql`** – Identifies top-performing or underperforming devices based on usage or alerts.  
3. **`usage_trends.sql`** – Analyzes device usage trends over time to support Trend Analysis & Forecasting.  
4. **`peak_usage.sql`** – Determines peak usage periods for devices (hours, days, or months).  
5. **`device_type_comparison.sql`** – Compares usage metrics across different device types to support procurement decisions.  
6. **`anomaly_detection.sql`** – Detects unusual or outlier device behavior using signal or alert data.  
7. **`usage_based_billing.sql`** – Calculates usage-based costs per device or department for cost allocation.  
8. **`lifecycle_management.sql`** – Identifies devices nearing end-of-life or showing declining performance.  
9. **`maintenance_effectiveness.sql`** – Evaluates maintenance activities, downtime, and technician performance.  
10. **`user_engagement.sql`** – Analyzes device engagement and usage patterns by users or locations.  

> **Purpose:** These queries allow users to **extract insights, generate reports, and answer business questions** directly from the IoT database. They demonstrate the ability to perform **data analysis, aggregations, joins, and trend detection** using SQL.
