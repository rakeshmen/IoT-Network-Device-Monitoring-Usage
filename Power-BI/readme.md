# IoT.pbix

This folder contains the **Power BI dashboard file** (`iot.pbix`) for the IoT Network Device Monitoring & Usage project.  

The dashboard visualizes insights derived from the SQL database and DAX measures, providing an **interactive view of IoT device performance, alerts, maintenance, and usage trends**.

---

## Key Features of the Dashboard

- **Device Performance Analysis** – Track uptime, latency, packet loss, and signal strength.  
- **Alert Monitoring** – Identify top failing devices and generate insights for predictive maintenance.  
- **Maintenance Insights** – Evaluate downtime, cost, and technician performance.  
- **Trend Analysis** – Analyze usage and performance trends over time.  
- **Device Comparison** – Compare device types, locations, and manufacturers.  
- **Interactive Filters** – Filter data by device, date, alert type, or maintenance type.

## Usage Instructions

1. Open the `.pbix` file in **Power BI Desktop**.  
2. Use **slicers and filters** to explore different aspects of device performance and trends.  
3. Measures and calculated columns (DAX) used in the dashboard are available in the `DAX-Measures` folder.  
4. For **static reference or sharing**, see the combined PDF report in the `Reports/` folder.
